# Self-Driving-Car-challenge
Udacity's self driving car challenge. 

The simulator can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

The model has been trained on the first track. I have collected the data manually by drivig the car first on the left side then on the right side. This is repeated again in the opposite direction.
